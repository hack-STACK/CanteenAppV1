# Menu Discount System Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The menu discount system was not properly calculating and applying discounts due to several issues:

1. **Column Name Mismatch**
   - Original query was using `menu_id` instead of `id_menu`
   - Incorrect path for nested discount information

2. **Data Override Issue**
   ```dart
   // Problem: Effective price was overriding calculated discount
   _discountedPrice = (discountData['effective_price'] as num).toDouble();
   ```

3. **Cache Validation Problem**
   ```dart
   // Old version only checked discounted price
   final hasValidDiscount = discountedPrice != null && 
                          discountedPrice! > 0 && 
                          discountedPrice! < price;

   // New version checks both price and percentage
   final hasValidDiscount = _discountedPrice != null && 
                          _discountedPrice! > 0 && 
                          _discountedPrice! < price &&
                          _discountPercentage != null &&
                          _discountPercentage! > 0;
   ```
